### 🖥️ 2. Software Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Arduino CLI](https://arduino.github.io/arduino-cli/)
- Install Python dependencies:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
---

### ⚙️ 3. Initial Setup

Install ESP32 Board in Arduino CLI:
 ```bash
  arduino-cli core install esp32:esp32
```
Compile & Upload Firmware:

Run the GUI or directly execute:

    python src/weather_analysis/weather_gui_launcher.py

Wi-Fi Credentials:

- Auto-detects and updates .ino with current SSID and password

- Eduroam/WPA2-Enterprise support with prompt for university credentials

Additional Setup Considerations:

- A cloud to record all numerical data (e.g. ThingsBoard)
- A web host to display data for the public to see
- A proxy server for any backend tasks, such as requesting data from the cloud (e.g. Microsoft Azure)

---

### 🖱️ 4. Launch GUI

Run with Python:
```bash
python src/weather_analysis/weather_gui_launcher.py
```

### 💡 5. How to Use

- Navigation Bar:
    * Weather: Clicking on this brings you to the Weather Section.
    * Dashboard: Clicking on this brings you to the the first dashboard in the Dashboard Section, the Temperature and Humidity time graph.
    * GitHub: Clicking on this brings you to the GitHub repository.
    * Moon toggle: Switches theme to light or dark mode. Refresh to see the switch automatically toggle on or off based on brightness level.

- Weather Section:
    * Shows basic numerical readings of temperature, humidity, brightness, and "feels like" temperature.

- Dashboard Section:
    * Temp and Humidity: Displays the time graph of temperature and humidity. Use this to see the trends of temperature and humidity.
    * Weather Predictor: Displays time graph of the predicted high and low temperatures of the next few days.
